        It creates (or just gets, if a matching Transaction is found with same
        ledger and idempotency_key) a

        transaction via the `Subsidy.redeem()` method.  Normally, the logic of
        this view

        is responsible for determining the price of the requested content key,
        with which

        the redeemed transaction's quantity will be valued.


        Note that, under some circumstances (for example, assigned learner
        content), it is

        appropriate and allowable for the *caller* of this view to request a
        specific price

        at which a redeemed transaction should occur.  In these circumstances,
        this service

        still does some validation of the requested price to ensure that it
        falls within

        a reasonable interval around the *true* price of the related content
        key. See:
