        ViewSet for CheckoutIntent model.


        Provides list, retrieve, and partial_update actions for CheckoutIntent
        records.

        Users can only access their own CheckoutIntent records, unless the user
        is staff,

        in which case all records can be accessed.


        This ViewSet intentionally does not utilize edx-rbac for permission
        checking,

        because most use cases involve requesting users who are not yet expected

        to have been granted any enterprise roles. Instead, we manage
        authorization

        via the ``get_queryset()`` method.


        Supports lookup by either 'id' (integer) or 'uuid' (UUID).

        Retrieve a specific CheckoutIntent by either ID or UUID. This endpoint
        is designed to support polling from the frontend to check the
        fulfillment state after a successful Stripe checkout. Users can only
        retrieve their own CheckoutIntent records. Supports lookup by either:

        - Integer ID (e.g., `/api/v1/checkout-intents/123/`)

        - UUID (e.g.,
        `/api/v1/checkout-intents/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/`)

      operationId: update_checkout_intent
      description: >+
        Update the state of a CheckoutIntent. This endpoint is used to
        transition the CheckoutIntent through its lifecycle states. Only valid
        state transitions are allowed. Users can only update their own
        CheckoutIntent records. Supports lookup by either:

        - Integer ID (e.g., `/checkout-intents/123/`)

        - UUID (e.g., `/checkout-intents/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/`)


        ## Allowed State Transitions

        ```

        created → paid

        created → errored_stripe_checkout

        paid → fulfilled

        paid → errored_provisioning

        errored_stripe_checkout → paid

        errored_provisioning → paid

        ```

        ## Integration Points

        - **Stripe Webhook**: Transitions from `created` to `paid` after
        successful payment

        - **Fulfillment**: Transitions from `paid` to `fulfilled` after
        provisioning

        - **Error Recovery**: Allows retry from error states back to `paid`

        Notes:

        * This endpoint is designed to be called AFTER logistration, but BEFORE
        displaying a payment entry form.  A
          Stripe "Checkout Session" object is a prerequisite to rendering the Stripe embedded component for payment
          entry.
        * The @permission_required() decorator has NOT been added. This endpoint
        only requires an authenticated LMS
          user, which is more permissive than our usual requirement for a user with an enterprise role.
        * This endpoint is NOT idempotent and will create new checkout sessions
        on each subsequent call.
          TODO: introduce an idempotency key and a new model to hold pending requests.
