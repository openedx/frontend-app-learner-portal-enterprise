      // without having to consider hard loading states, extending the `cacheTime` can help prevent JS errors around

      // explicit loading states when query keys change. Note: `keepPreviousData` is deprecated, replaced
      // by `placeholderData` in `@tanstack/react-query` v5 (i.e., for when React is upgraded to v18). See

      // components. However, in some cases (e.g., if a query is reset), we attempt to access object properties
      // on `undefined` data (i.e., `isLoading: true`) resulting in JS errors. To prevent this error from throwing,
